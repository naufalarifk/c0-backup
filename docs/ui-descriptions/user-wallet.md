Looking at these mobile app screenshots, I can see they represent a cryptocurrency wallet application called "CryptoGadai" with transaction history filtering functionality. Let me describe each page and then arrange them in logical order.

## Page Descriptions:

**Page 1 (Image 5) - Main Dashboard/Home:**
- **Header:** Blue gradient background with "CryptoGadai" logo and notification bell icon
- **Balance Card:** White card showing "My Balance" with $127,856.43 and a lock icon, plus blue "Withdraw" button
- **Assets Section:** Horizontal tabs for different cryptocurrencies (USDT, BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB)
- **Asset Display:** Shows USDT (Tether) with 2,150.00 USDT value, $2,150.00 (+0.1%)
- **Pending Transactions Section:** 
  - Withdrawal of 0.025 BTC (Pending, Est. 10 min)
  - Loan Collateral of 1.2 ETH (Locked, Est. 10 min)
- **Quick Actions:** "Transaction History" button with arrow
- **Bottom Navigation:** Home, Loans, Market, Wallet, Profile tabs

**Page 2 (Image 1) - Transaction History with Period Filter:**
- **Header:** "Transaction History" with back arrow
- **Filter Controls:** 
  - "All Currencies" dropdown
  - "All Types" dropdown
  - "Last 30 days" dropdown with calendar icon
- **Transaction List:**
  - Withdrawal: -$500.00 USDT (Pending, 1 day ago)
  - Deposit: +$1,500.00 USDT (Completed, 2 hours ago)
  - Interest Payment: +$25.50 USDT (Completed, 2 hours ago)
  - Loan Collateral: 0.025 BTC/$1,250.00 (Locked, 5 hours ago)
  - Deposit: +$1,500.00 USDT (Completed, 2 hours ago)
- **Filter Modal:** "Select Periode" with "Last 30 days" dropdown, Submit and Reset buttons

**Page 3 (Image 2) - Transaction History with Type Filter:**
- **Same transaction list as Page 2**
- **Filter Modal:** "All Types" with "Select Types" dropdown, Submit and Reset buttons
- **Purpose:** Allows filtering by transaction type (deposits, withdrawals, interest payments, etc.)

**Page 4 (Image 3) - Transaction History with Currency Filter:**
- **Same transaction list as Page 2**
- **Filter Modal:** "All Currencies" with "Select Currencies" dropdown, Submit and Reset buttons
- **Purpose:** Allows filtering by specific cryptocurrency types

**Page 5 (Image 4) - Transaction History Extended:**
- **Same header and filters as other transaction pages**
- **Extended Transaction List:** Shows additional transaction at bottom
  - Failed Withdrawal: -$500.00 USDT (Failed, 1 day ago)
- **Load More:** "Load More Transactions" button at bottom
- **Purpose:** Shows pagination functionality for viewing more historical transactions

## Logical Order:

The logical flow would be:

1. **Page 1 (Dashboard)** - Starting point where users see their balance and can access transaction history
2. **Page 2 (Transaction History - Period Filter)** - Initial transaction history view with time-based filtering
3. **Page 3 (Transaction History - Type Filter)** - Same view but showing transaction type filtering options
4. **Page 4 (Transaction History - Currency Filter)** - Same view but showing currency-based filtering options
5. **Page 5 (Transaction History Extended)** - Shows more transactions with pagination functionality

## User Interaction Flow:

Users would typically:
1. Start at the dashboard to view their balance and pending transactions
2. Tap "Transaction History" to view their complete transaction history
3. Use the filter dropdowns to narrow down transactions by:
   - Time period (last 30 days, custom dates)
   - Transaction type (deposits, withdrawals, interest payments, loan collateral)
   - Currency (USDT, BTC, ETH, etc.)
4. Apply filters using Submit button or clear them with Reset
5. Load additional historical transactions using "Load More Transactions" button
6. Navigate back to other sections using the bottom navigation tabs

The interface provides comprehensive transaction management with multiple filtering options to help users track their cryptocurrency activities effectively.
